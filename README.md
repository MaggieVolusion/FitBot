# FitBot
Slack bot that gives you hourly workouts

To get it started, simply tell it "start" to receice the default set of exercises. You can open a direct message conversation to "@hourlyfitness", or invite it to a channel.
On the hour, within the standard work week, and within standard work hours(8am-6pm), it will provide you a random workout with a random number of reps.
Instead of telling the bot, "start", you can specify which group you'd like to focus on when starting the bot up.
To select a focus on core, tell the bot, "start core".
To select a focus on legs, tell the bot, "start legs".
To select a focus on upper-body, tell the bot, "start upperbody", "start upper body", or "start arms".
To stop receiving those workouts, simply tell the bot, "stop".
To receive a list of commands, tell the bot "help".

The bot only sends 1 message on the hour to prevent too much spam.
