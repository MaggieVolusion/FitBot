# FitBot
Slack bot that gives you hourly workouts

To get it started, simply tell it "start". You can open a direct message conversation to "@hourlyfitness", or invite it to a channel.
On the hour, within the standard work week, and within standard work hours(8am-6pm), it will provide you a random workout with a random number of reps.
To stop receiving those workouts, simply tell the bot, "stop".
To receive a list of commands, tell the bot "help".

The bot only sends 1 message on the hour to prevent too much spam.
